# 🗳️ Project VOTE – Blockchain Voting Application

## 📚 About the Project

Project VOTE is a Swift-based iOS application
designed as part of a third-year university project
to explore how users feel about voting using blockchain technology.
The app simulates a secure and modern digital voting experience,
incorporating user validation, vote casting, and feedback collection.

This project aims to:
- Evaluate user perceptions of digital voting
- Measure trust levels in blockchain-based systems
- Provide a clean, user-friendly voting experience on mobile

## 🧠 Project Purpose

In many democracies, voter turnout is decreasing due to barriers
like accessibility, trust, and outdated systems. 
This app investigates whether **blockchain-powered voting**, 
presented through a familiar and intuitive mobile app,
can encourage voter participation and boost confidence in
election integrity.
